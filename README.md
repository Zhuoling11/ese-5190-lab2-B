## Outline of Design
We Plan to use the ADS9960 to test the distance from the sensor. If the distance is very close at some value, the RED LED will flash. If it returns to the normal distances at  some value, the red LED will turn off and the yellow LED will turn on. Will will change some details if we have some better ideas.

About the Problems in this lab

Q1: we are not fimilar with how to interact with the sensor using C. May more examples can help a lot

Q2 The connection of GPIO is not very stable
